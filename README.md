# ac-exploit-gc
An exploit for all the gamecube versions of animal crossing, you only need a method of injecting the two needed .gci files onto your memory card.  
This exploit will load a boot.dol converted with dol2gci (included in Home Bros.) from your memory card.  
To trigger the exploit, load up the town, go into the house, click on the nes, exit the nes with l+r+z, exit the house and lastly save and quit.  
I know right now that is a bit slow but that is all to avoid resetti if you want to boot the exploit again later, at least it works at all ;)  

This exploit was made possible thanks to:  
The original find by jamchamb, read up on how he did it if you are interested:

The great work by Cuyler36 for writing both ACSE:

and the original ACNESCreator:

Though this does not use that original version, I just made some small changes to make it easier to work for all the versions I have to compile:
